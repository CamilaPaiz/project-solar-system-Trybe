# Project Solar System
In this project I had to develop an application in React, using Class components and props.
This apllication simulates a view of our Solar System, as well as information about various space missions that have taken place
throughout history.

The Planets images and mission information were provided by Trybe in the project.
We had to develop the components to display them on the screen as described in the requirements.

 In this project it was possible to verify the following skills:
-Using JSX in React;
-The use of render() method to render the components;
-The use of import to bring components into different files;
-Create Class Components in React;
-Verify the use of props correctly;
-Verify the use of PropTypes to validate a component's props;
-Create multiple components from an array.
